    <div> "Download By an External Download Manager" provides a configurable external download manager integration.
        You can define file-size, file-type, and whether the download server supports multi-threading or not in the
        options page.
        <hr>
        If all these conditions met and the extension is enabled from the toolbar button (place your mouse over the
        toolbar button to see
        the current enable or disable status), then the downloading job is sent to the external download manager.
        Unlike the default integrators which are usually too aggressive, this integrator works only when the conditions
        are fully met hence
        you will get fewer false-positive calls when the external integration is not welcomed. Also, note that this
        extension is very
        lightweight compared to the default integrators. When it is disabled, there is no resource usage at all. When it
        is enabled, the
        minimum possible observer is placed on your network to capture jobs and evaluate them to decide whether the job
        is meant to be handled
        by your browser or by the external download manager.

        This extension is configured to integrate your browser with the well-known IDM download manager. Note that IDM
        offers an
        official integrator which is too aggressive in my opinion. If you prefer this one over the official one, I would
        recommend
        disabling that extension from the extension manager of your browser. When the extension is installed, you will
        get a
        toolbar icon. Press it once to enable the network observer and the second time to disable it. The current status
        of the
        network observer can be viewed by placing your mouse over the toolbar button. When the network observer is
        enabled, the
        extension listens for all top-level requests that are not in text or HTML format. If the file-size and
        multi-threading
        status are met with user-defined configurations then the downloading job will be sent to the IDM executable and
        your
        browser will display a new page containing the download information such as its content-type or file-size. If
        for any reason
        you prefer your browser to handle this type of files, use the "Add to the exception list" in this page to
        permanently exclude
        them from being sent to IDM. You can add or remove file-types from the options page as well. Note that on the
        first run, you
        will be asked to install a native client. This is the only reliable method to communicate with an external
        executable. In this
        application, I use an open-source native-client written based on NodeJS. Note that even if the network observer
        is disabled from
        the toolbar area, you can still send link, image, video, and audio sources to the external download manager by
        using the provided
        right-click context menu items.
